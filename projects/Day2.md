**Case study 1:**

- It's Week 2 and you've noticed one of your students, Tom Jerry, is very disengaged. Tom has not been attending guided projects and has been skipping stand-ups, and when they do attend, they have their camera off or are clearly demonstrating they aren't paying attention.

    - Just talk to the student. Ask to speak to the student 1:1. When you meet, express your concerns kindly. Maybe talk about the camera being off first, because it's a lesser issue. Not attending stand-up and guided projects are a bigger problem, so explain their importance and the benefits of being in class/SU and if that doesn't change the student's mindset or you're not getting the right feedback from them, explain how not attending gets noted and adds up as absences. You can only miss so many hours a month.


- Part 2: Another student in your group comes to you and says Tom's behavior in stand-up is making them feel uncomfortable talking through their project.

    - I believe the answer to this drastically depends on the type of behavior Tom is displaying. That being said, nothing that makes a student uncomfortable should be taken lightly, so talk to Tom. Don't mention names of the students to reached out to you to Tom. This is something that, again, depending on the behavior, of course, should probably be mentioned to our SL, too.

**Case study 2:**

- You've noticed one of your students, Draco Malfoy, consistently tries to take over the group. They are disruptive in Slack and in stand-ups. They are consistently showing off, cutting other people off from talking, and they are very hard for others to work with in a group. Multiple students have reached out to you to say they are upset by Draco's behavior.

    - Meet with Draco 1:1. Explain how their behavior (cutting people off, especially) is disruptive, nicely, giving them the benefit of the doubt that they may be acting out for other reasons. Ask if there is anything that's bothering them, maybe, outside of school. This would also be a good case to direct this student to the show_it_off channel, as that could be a good outlet for that part of their behavior.

**Case study 3:**

- You are finishing up a Sprint Challenge 1:1 review with one of your students. The student did not meet MVP for their sprint challenge, and you notice they seem to be taking the news very hard. In talking through the situation with the student, they reveal to you that they have been struggling with mental health concerns, feeling very overwhelmed, and are burnt out.

    - Empathy and compassion. I've been flexed before, I know how this feels. Flexing really helped me and that's something I can use to help this student. I would also direct this student to Modern Health and make sure they're utilizing the mental health benefits we get through Lambda, I think that would be beneficial in this case. Just talk to this student until they are feeling better, they may just need someone to talk to. Never give out mental health advice, of course, but sometimes, students just need to feel heard.

**Case study 4:**

- You are reviewing a student's code/project, and you are fairly positive they plagiarized.

**Case study 5:**

- You've noticed one of your students who is on the quieter side does a phenomenal job - consistently completes assignments and stretch goals, but will not participate in the group or speak-up in channels or during stand-up.

**Case study 6:**

- A student comes to you, very clearly upset, and reports that they feel they were being harassed or discriminated against by another student.
