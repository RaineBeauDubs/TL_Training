# Part One:

* ENFP - T
  # Is this accurate?
    - Yes, I do believe this is accurate. I’ve taken 3 versions of this test in the last 10 years, and I’ve gotten the same combination every time.
  # How does this align or differ with your preferred communication style or work style? What are those preferred styles and how does that impact your role as a student, as a TL, as a professional?
    - Under “Workplace Habits,” I found this quote: “People with the Campaigner personality type possess warmth, creativity, and an open-mindedness that makes them excellent listeners.” I really like this and I feel as if it describes my communication style, at least in part. I am an active listener and empathizer. I truly hear and take what is being said into careful consideration. This is helpful when it comes conflict resolution, and also just to help people know that their feelings are valid and matter to someone. 


According to the Oxford Dictionary, the definition of a leader is "the person who leads or commands a group, organization, or country," and sure, that's true, but good leader is more. A good leader leads by example and doesn't ever leave anyone behind. A good leader pushes everyone, including themselves, to reach their full potential. A good leader doesnt just lead a group, they are an active part of a group. 
I think I have a bit of a leg-up in training this week because I've been a TL before. I'll be doing CS instead of fundamentals, but I know where some of my strengths and weaknesses lie from PM-ing for WEB19. As I described in my last answer above, I am a good listener, and that, alone, can go a long way. Showing empathy and kindness, without being "hand-holdy," is how I aim to lead. I know what I know and don't know, and if I don't know the answer to a students question, we find the answer together. If that fails, we find someone who knows, or knows how to find the answer. I am well aware that I am still a student and that I don't know all of the things. I know that I struggle with imposter syndrome that that I'm going to have bad days where I feel like I didn't help anyone. I know that I have many areas as a developer that need constant improvement on my part. I also know that I'm still going to be a good TL.
